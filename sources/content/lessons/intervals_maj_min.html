<h1>Intervals in Major and Minor Scales</h1>
<p>We already know the intervals between adjacent notes in major and minor scales (whole and half steps), but
    what about the intervals formed by different combinations? In this section we will deepen our understanding
    of intervals by looking at those that are formed going up from the tonic to each of the other notes of major
    and minor scales.</p>
<h2>Intervals in Major Scales</h2>
<p>When measured up from the tonic, <a href="scales_major.html">major scales</a> use only major intervals (2nd,
    3rd, 6th, and 7th) and perfect intervals (unison, 4th, 5th, and octave). Also, the names of the intervals in
    the major scale correspond to the scale degree numbers. That is, for example, the interval between C (scale
    degree 1) and A (scale degree 6) is a major 6th.</p>

<p>Many of the intervals in the natural minor scale are the same as intervals found in the major scale: major
    2nd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, and octave. However, the natural minor scale contains a minor 3rd, 6th, and
    7th, whereas the major scale contains a major 3rd, 6th, and 7th. It should be noted that while the pitches
    of the major scale create only major and perfect intervals with the tonic, the pitches of the minor scale
    create minor, major, and perfect intervals with the tonic.</p>
<h3>Melodic Minor</h3>
<p>Compared to the natural minor scale, the <a href="scales_minor_mel_har.html"><b>melodic minor scale</b></a>
    has a raised 6th and 7th degree, but only when it is ascending. Descending, the melodic minor scale is the
    same as the natural minor scale.</p>
<p>Here are the intervals in the <i>ascending</i> melodic minor scale (the places where the pattern differs from
    the natural minor scale are highlighted):</p>

<h3>Harmonic Minor</h3>
