<h1>Principles of Form</h1>
<p><b>Form</b> is the large-scale organization or shape of a piece of music. Formal structure helps listeners to
    perceive a piece as logical or coherent. Form is shaped by repeating material, varying familiar material,
    and introducing contrasting material.</p>
<p>To see these principles at work, visit <a href="form_archetypes.html">Form Archetypes</a>, <a href="form_popular.html">Form
    in Popular Music</a>, and <a href="form_art.html">Form in Art Music</a>.</p>
<h2>Repetition</h2>
<p>When we describe a piece as 'catchy', we are really saying that it is easy to remember. Repetition is what
    allows sections of music to become familiar and fixed in our memories in that way. Repetition is also used
    in long pieces to maintain a sense of coherence and unity.</p>
<p>Although any element of music can be repeated (a note, a rhythm, a harmony, etc.), formal repetition refers
    to the recurrence of entire sections. In notation, these repeats are often indicated by a double barline and
    two dots. These are called <b>repeat signs</b>. Repeat signs often appear with <b>first and second
        endings</b>, which provide alternate measures of music for the first and second time a section is
    played.</p>

            played instead. Second endings will always follow first endings with repeat signs (see above).

<p>There are also several other words and symbols that are used to indicate the order in which sections should
    be played and repeated. The chart below shows these symbols along with their names and meanings.</p>

        <td><img src="../images/notation/repeat_dc.png" alt="da capo" /></td>
        <td><i>Da capo</i></td>
        <td>Literally, 'from the head', this indication means to return to the beginning and play everything
            again.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/notation/repeat_fine.png" alt="fine" /></td>
        <td><i>Fine</i></td>
        <td>Literally, 'end', this symbol is used when the form of a piece is made complex by repetition, and
            the end of the piece falls at the end of an internal section rather than at the end of the notated
            measures. <i>Fine</i> is often used together with <i>da capo</i> (see below).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/notation/repeat_dcalfine.png" alt="da capo al fine" /></td>
        <td><i>Da capo al fine</i></td>
        <td>Literally, 'from the head to the end', this is used when the composer wants the beginning of a piece
            to be repeated, but does not want the whole thing to be heard again. The performer should return to
            the beginning and play up until <i>fine</i> appears in the music (see above).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/notation/repeat_coda.png" alt="coda" /></td>
        <td>Coda</td>
        <td>From the Italian for 'tail', a coda is an extra section added at the end of a piece. Typically, the
            symbol to the left is used in the main body of the piece to indicate when the performer should jump
            from the main body to the coda. By convention, the performer never skips to the coda on the first
            time through a section, but only after a repeat has occurred. The coda itself is marked with either
            'coda' or both the symbol and the word.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/notation/repeat_segno.png" alt="segno" /></td>
        <td><i>Segno</i></td>
        <td>Meaning 'sign' in Italian, the <i>segno</i> is used to mark where a repetition should begin. This is
            used only when the form is too complex for a forward repeat sign to be used.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/notation/repeat_dsalcoda.png" alt="dal segno al coda" /></td>
        <td><i>Dal segno al Coda</i></td>
        <td>Literally 'from the sign to the coda', this indicates that the player should go to the <i>segno</i>,
            play to the coda symbol, then go to the coda and play it as well.
        </td>
    </tr>

<h2>Contrast</h2>
<p>In music, contrast is used to create variety and build drama and tension. By withholding familiar material
    and using contrasting music instead, the composer can create discomfort, longing, or disorientation in an
    audience. In longer pieces, repetition helps create cohesion, but alone it is not enough to hold the
    attention of an audience. Contrast is introduced into these pieces to maintain interest and spread out
    repetition. Drama can also be achieved through the use of contrasting material. Following a quiet section
    with a loud one, or a slow section with a fast one can surprise and disorient audiences, while following a
    lifeless section with a triumphant one can invigorate them.</p>
<h2>Variation</h2>
<p>Variation is essentially a combination of the principles of repetition and contrast. Variation occurs when a
    section returns, but is not identical to its previous iteration(s). Some aspects of the section remain the
    same so that it is (usually) recognizable, but others are changed to create variety. Thus variation allows
    for both the familiarity of repetition and the interest of contrast.</p>
